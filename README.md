# Parallel-Computing-Course-Design-Spring-2025
The research focuses on high-performance parallelization solutions for "image grayscale batch processing", using four mainstream parallel computing models: multi-threaded parallelism based on OpenMP, parallelism based on MPI, GPU-accelerated parallelism based on CUDA, and a hybrid parallel mode combining MPI and OpenMP.
